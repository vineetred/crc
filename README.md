# CRC Checking

Aprogram to implement CRC error detection technique. In particular, there are two components to it: 

1. CRC Encoding (Sender Side)
2. CRC Decoding (Receiver Side)

Both of these are implemented using Python 3.6.

Also, on top of CRC, the program uses bit stuffing to transmit files.
